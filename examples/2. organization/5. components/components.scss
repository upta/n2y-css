// For web frameworks that insert a custom tag name at the root of the component
component-name {
  color: teal;
}

// For web frameworks that don't insert a custom tag; add this class name to the root
.component-name {
  color: teal;
}

// Some more modern frameworks you don't actually have to worry about this
// because they handle scoping component css themselves
